# Exercise 2
[(_back to main readme_)](../README.md)

We've created a workflow which has executed to build our initial environment - ***Please shout if you didn't get a successful run before we continue***.
Now we're going to try using the inbuilt IDE and edit our workflow through this.
1. Click `Code` in the navigation column, then `Dev Environments`. Each project should have a single dev environment called `coderepo/main`. Click on the link in the IDE column titled `Resume in AWS Cloud9`
2. This will start our IDE, and after a delay as the environment initialises we should be placed in an IDE. The ide should have 3 panes, a file explorer on the left, an editor space at the top, and a terminal at the bottom.
3. You should be able to see the name of our repo in the explorer near the top left, and if we change into the terminal at the bottom, we can enter the command `cd coderepo`.
4. Let's create a new branch - type `git checkout -b new_branch_name` replacing `new_branch_name` with an appropriate name.
5. Using the explorer pane, expand the coderepo folder and click through `.codecatalyst/workflows` until we see the yaml file we created in the previous exercise to house our workflow. Double click on the name to open the file in the editor.

##Â Part 1 - check our environment.
Let's add a new action to our workflow to check that the environment we built is in place, and then we'll use it to test our python code for the lambda we'll deploy.
1. Scroll to the end of the workflow file, which should have the shell commands you previously defined.
2. Paste the following code
```  
  Test_Phase:
    Identifier: aws/managed-test@v1
    Inputs:
      Sources:
        - WorkflowSource
    Outputs:
      AutoDiscoverReports:
        Enabled: false
        ReportNamePrefix: rpt
    Configuration:
      Steps:
        - Run: |
            echo "Check pytest is installed"
            python -m pytest --help
    Compute:
      Type: EC2
    DependsOn:
      - Init
```
***Make sure that the action in the `DependsOn` section uses the name of the action you defined in the first exercise.***
1. We've now added a test section (_see the identifier_) which we'll use to perform some tests against the code, but for now we're just checking the one of the tools, pytest, we installed in the previous action is available.
2. Save the file, either by `ctrl/cmd-s` or clicking `File > Save` in the menu at the top.
3. We can now use either the terminal or the git ide to update the repo. For the `terminal`
   1. In the terminal, enter the command `git status` and we should see that our modified file is listed in the `changes not staged for commit` section
   2. Enter the command `git add` followed by the name of our file to stage it in git
   3. Enter the command `git commit -m 'Added test phase'`
4. To use the `git IDE`, 
   1. Click on the small branch symbol in the navigator pane
   2. Click the plus sign next to our modified file in the explorer
   3. Enter a commit message
   4. `ctrl+enter` or `cmd+enter` to record the message for the comit
5. Click the small refresh symbol next to the branch name at the bottom of the screen to push our code back to the repository.
6. In the previous browser tab, click `CI/CD` and `Workflow`. We should see a new run listed against the workflow in the new branch. Click the run name and monitor the `Logs` section.
7. After a short period, we should see a red `x` next to the `pytest help` command.

## Why did our run fail?
Each action runs in a separate container, so when we installed the libraries and tools in the first action, they weren't visible in the second action's container.

## How to fix.
To make the files installed in our first container available to the second, we need to output an archive from the first file containing the library files (_held under /root/.local_), and then import that action in the 2nd action.

1. In the IDE editor, scroll to the first action and enter the following under the `Autodiscovered Reports` under `Outputs` section, just above `Configuration`
```
      Artifacts:
        - Name: pythonLibs
          Files:
            - /root/.local/**/*
```
(***Check the indentation***)
2. Scroll down to our new test action, and just above `Outputs` paste
```
      Artifacts:
        - pythonLibs
```
3. In the `Steps` section of our 2nd action, add the new step above the existing one
```
        - Run: |
            echo "Copying artifacts from build on ${HOSTNAME}"
            mv ${CATALYST_SOURCE_DIR_pythonLibs}/root/.local ~
            export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
            cd src
```
(***Again check indents***)
4. Save, stage, commit and sync our changes back to the repo (as above)
5. Check the workflow and we should see a new run which should complete successfully this time.
6. If you can't get the workflow working, use [example_workflow_with_artifacts.yaml](example_workflow_with_artifacts.yaml)

## Adding tests
Now that we have our installed tools available, we can proceed to analyse our lambda and terraform code. 

The lambda code is stored in `src/`, unit tests in `src/unittests` and terraform in `terraform`. We will use [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) to check our python code for vulnerabilities, [tfsec](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec) to check out terraform, and run unit tests to validate our lambda code.

Let's add those to our workflow.

1. Open the workflow file in our editor if it's not already (_hint, it's in `.codecatalyst/workflows`_)
2. Scroll down to the `Steps` section in the test action.
3. Replace these lines
```
        - Run: |
            echo "Check pytest is installed"
            python -m pytest --help
```
with
```
        - Run: |
            echo "Running unit tests"
            python -m pytest
            true
        - Run: |
            echo "Running bandit vulnerability scanner"
            bandit -r . --format sarif --output junit/bandit.sarif
            true    # Ignore failures flagged by bandit
        - Run: |
            echo "Installing and running tfsec"
            cd ../terraform
            wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/releases/download/v1.28.1/tfsec-linux-amd64 -O tfsec
            chmod +x ./tfsec
            ./tfsec . --format sarif > ../src/junit/tfsec.sarif
            true
```
*The first command runs pytest, the second bandit, and the 3rd downloads `tfsec` and then executes it.*

4. Save, stage, commit and sync our changes back to the repo (as above)
5. Check the workflow and we should see a new run which should complete successfully this time.
6. If you can't get the workflow working, use [example_workflow_with_tests.yaml](example_workflow_with_tests.yaml)
